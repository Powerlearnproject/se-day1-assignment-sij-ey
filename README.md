#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

=>Software engineering is a science and art of designing, building and maintaining software solutions that solve real world problems.Software engineering ensures that the resulting products are reliable, scalable, efficient, and maintainable which are highly recommended in the technology industry


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.)The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was formally introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
The conference highlighted the "software crisis," where software systems became increasingly complex, leading to frequent failures and cost overruns.

2.) The Rise of Structured Programming
Introduction of structured programming principles led to developers moving away from spaghetti code and adapt Concepts like functions, loops, and control structures (if-else, for-loops, etc.) which improved code readability and maintainability.

3.)The Development of Object-Oriented Programming 
The rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with languages like C++ and Java introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code more reusable and modular.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    1. Planning -Define project goals, feasibility, and scope.
    2. Requirements Analysis -Gather and document software requirements.
    3. Design -Define the software architecture, user interface, and system flow.
    4. Implementation (Coding & Development) -Convert design specifications into working code.
    5. Testing -Identify and fix software defects before deployment.
    6. Deployment -Release the software for use.
    7. Maintenance & Support -Ensure software remains functional, updated, and secure.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
->*Waterfall*
     Sequential, linear process (step-by-step).
     Follows a fixed sequence (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance).
     Rigid—once a phase is completed, changes are difficult.
     Clearly defined before development begins.
     Minimal—client involvement is mostly at the beginning.
     Best for large, well-defined projects.
     High risk—issues may be discovered late in development.
     Slower—the full product is delivered at the end.
     
->Waterfall is best for Banking & Financial Software(extra security)


->-*Agile*
     Iterative, flexible process (continuous cycles).
     Uses sprints/iterations where requirements and solutions evolve.
     Flexible—changes can be made anytime based on feedback.
     Requirements evolve throughout development.
     High—clients provide continuous feedback after each iteration.
     Best for dynamic, evolving projects.
     Lower risk—problems are identified and fixed early.
     Faster—small, working versions are delivered frequently.

->Agile is best for Web & E-commerce Platforms(frequent updates and new features


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

->Software Developer
        =>Responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions.
->Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
        =>Ensures that the software meets quality standards and functions correctly before release.
->Project Manager (PM)
        =>Oversees the software development process, ensuring timely delivery and alignment with business goals.
        

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

->IDEs enhance coding efficiency with smart features like autocompletion, debugging, and project management ie Visual Studio Code
->VCS ensures smooth collaboration, version tracking, and code safety in team-based development  ie Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  ->Debugging and Fixing Bugs;-Use debugging toolsto trace issues.
                            -Use version control (Git) to track changes and revert faulty code when needed.
  ->Security Vulnerabilities & Cyber Threats;-Follow secure coding practices 
                                           -Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
  ->Time Management & Meeting Deadlines;-Break projects into smaller, manageable tasks with realistic deadlines.
                                      -Communicate delays early and adjust priorities accordingly.
  ->Working with Unclear or Changing Requirements;-Conduct regular meetings with stakeholders to clarify expectations.
                                                -Use Agile methodologies to accommodate changing requirements.  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
     1. Unit Testing
            Focuses on testing individual components or units of code (e.g., functions, methods, or classes).
            Importance:dentifies bugs early in development making debugging easier by isolating errors.
     2.Integration Testing
            Tests how different modules or components work together after being integrated.
            Importance:Detects issues in module interaction and ensures seamless communication between frontend and backend.
     3. System Testing
            Tests the entire software system as a whole in an environment that mimics real-world usage.
            Importance:Helps identify performance, security, and usability issues ensuring compatibility with hardware, databases, and third-party services.
     
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

  ->Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to achieve better, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses from AI models.It enhances response quality, improves efficiency, and ensures AI delivers useful, unbiased, and context-aware outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    ->Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."
    ->Improved Prompt: "Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming the automotive industry. Provide real-world examples and discuss its benefits and challenges."
               explanation-->it has a specific topic(automotive industry) and Clear expectations as it asks for real-world examples and a discussion of benefits and challenges.
